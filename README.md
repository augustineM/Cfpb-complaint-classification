# complaintData
exploring data in the CFPB consumer complaint database.

In this project I explore the contents of the cfpb complaint database with the goal of understanding the data and determining wheterh or not there was enough information to apply predictive analytics methods.
After examining the database, the main feature was the consumer complaint narrative describing the complaint. After examination, I relying on the textual features of the consumer complaint narrative and NLP to predict how a complaint is resolved. 

project is split into parts:
-working with the data
  --wranglng, importing, merging, organizing
-understanding the dataset
  --graphs, interactions,etc.
-analytics
  --converting text to a useable form for analysis
  --predicting which complaints will be resolved with 'monetary relief'
